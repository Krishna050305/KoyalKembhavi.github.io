## 🌏 About the Project

**Echoes of Japan** is a static tourism website created to showcase the **beauty, culture, seasons, and travel experiences of Japan**. The website is designed with a strong visual focus, smooth navigation, and seasonal exploration to give users an immersive feel of Japanese tourism.

This project is built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, without any external frameworks, making it lightweight, fast, and beginner-friendly.
